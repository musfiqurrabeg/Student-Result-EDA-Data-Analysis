# Student Exam EDA Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of student exam performance data. The notebook explores key patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset, leveraging Python's powerful data analysis and visualization libraries.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Gain insights into student exam performance through descriptive statistics and data cleaning.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize Seaborn and Matplotlib to create meaningful charts and graphs for better understanding.
- **Python Libraries**: Employ libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and others to process and analyze data efficiently.
- **Structured Workflow**: Clear organization of steps, from importing libraries to interpreting findings.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Installed libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
